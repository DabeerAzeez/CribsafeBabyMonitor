*** This is Team 7's Python Program for DP-3 ***
Code written by: Dabeer Abdul-Azeez (abdulazd) and Trevor Tung (tungt1)

'''
DISCLAIMER:

This python program has multiple threads:
    - One for the main loop
    - One for the GUI
    - And one for the buzzer output

The submitted folder includes multiple python files:
    - A main file (main loop, variables, multithread-functions)
    - An objectives file (all functions which are not targeted by their own thread, including all four objectives)
    - A MyThread file (a threading subclass definition, used in the main file to run the GUI and buzzer in parallel with the main while loop)
    - A GUI file (which initializes the GUI that is updated in the main file by its own thread)

    - There is also a logo image which is used by the GUI, feel free to open it up in full resolution and save it to your desktop
    - and some .idea / venv folders which were made by PyCharm... we didn't want to delete them just to be safe
